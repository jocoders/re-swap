# ReSwap

**Overview**

ReSwap is a decentralized finance (DeFi) application built on Ethereum, designed to facilitate the swapping of ERC20 tokens and management of liquidity pools. It extends the core functionalities of Uniswap V2, incorporating advanced features and optimizations for better performance and security in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

**Features**

- **Liquidity Management**: Users can add or remove liquidity in a decentralized manner.
- **Token Swapping**: Direct token swaps without the need for a router, ensuring direct interaction with the contract.
- **Flash Loan Support**: Compliant with ERC-3156, dedicated function for flash loans separate from the swap function.
- **Optimized Gas Usage**: Utilizes assembly code for critical paths to reduce gas costs.
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Ensures the security of transactions against reentrancy attacks.

**Technology**

ReSwap uses Solidity 0.8.20, leveraging the latest compiler optimizations and safety features. It integrates the Solady library for ERC20 token standards and mathematical operations, including an efficient square root calculation essential for liquidity math.

**Getting Started**

**Prerequisites**

- Node.js and npm
- Foundry (for local deployment and testing)

**Installation**

1. Install Foundry if it's not already installed:

   ```bash
   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
   foundryup
   ```

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jocoders/re-swap.git
   cd re-swap
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   forge install
   ```

**Testing**

Run tests using Foundry:

```bash
forge test
```
````

**Usage**

**Deploying the Contracts**

Deploy the contracts to a local blockchain using Foundry:

```bash
forge create src/ReSwapFactory.sol:ReSwapFactory --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
forge create src/ReSwapPair.sol:ReSwapPair --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
```

**Interacting with the Contracts**

_Add Liquidity_

```solidity
function addLiquidity(uint256 tokenAmountA, uint256 tokenAmountB) external returns (uint256 liquidity)
```

_Remove Liquidity_

```solidity
function removeLiquidity(uint256 liquidity, uint256 minAmountA, uint256 minAmountB) external returns (uint256 amountA, uint256 amountB)
```

_Swap Tokens_

```solidity
function swapExactTokensForTokens(uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOutMin, address tokenA, address tokenB) external returns (uint256 amountOut)
```
